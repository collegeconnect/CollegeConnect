### Important Note: Firebase Integration
Since the project is hosted on Firebase, we cannot share our google-serivces.json file due to secrurity purposes. 

So, once you fork the project you'll have to link the app to your own firebase account before running the app. [Click here to know how to add firebase to your project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup?authuser=0)

If you face any issues while linking to firebase you can ask your doubt at our [Gitter Channel](https://gitter.im/CollegeConnect/community?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)
